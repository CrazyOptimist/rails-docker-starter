# Ruby on Rails Development Kit Containerized

## How to use?

```shell
docker-compose build
```

Now you have an awesome and smart image named `rails-docker-starter_rails:latest`, you can specify ruby version and node version in Dockerfile according to your need. <br>

All you need to do is <br>

Bind mount your container and run the rails command like so: <br>

```shell
rails new your-project-name
```

That's it. There you go. ðŸ˜Ž <br>

Happy coding rubyists!
